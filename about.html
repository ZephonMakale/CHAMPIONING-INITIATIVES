            <h2>Championing Initiatives</h2>

            <p>
              Championing Initiative is a project in Kenya that seeks to help
              solve issues affecting the underserved women and girls in the
              society, such as Gender Based Violence cases, e.g. forced child
              marriages, teenage pregnancies and Female Genital Mutilation by
              empowering girls out of school through ICT skills, Graphic
              Designs, Digital Art, adult literacy and creating a network of
              girl mentors.
            </p>
            <p>
              It seeks to fulfill vision 2030 through SDG 4:4: ‘By 2030, ensure
              that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to
              promote sustainable development, including, among others, through
              education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles,
              human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and
              non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural
              diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable
              development’
            </p>
            <p>
              At Championing Initiative, we believe in gender equity -
              giving women and girls equal opportunities as boys, to thrive and
              excel in life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Championing Initiative works in remote and hard to reach areas in
              Kenya. Our goal is to educate and empower them to become advocates
              against the injustices they face in the society.
